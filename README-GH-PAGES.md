# Modlitewnik — Deploy to GitHub Pages

This folder contains a small static prayer and songbook site. The repository can be published to GitHub Pages so you can open it on your smartphone via HTTPS.

Quick steps to publish (replace USERNAME and REPO):

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial site"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/USERNAME/REPO.git
git push -u origin main
```

After pushing, GitHub Actions (workflow included) will build and publish the site to the `gh-pages` branch. The site will be available at:

```
https://USERNAME.github.io/REPO/
```

Notes:
- Make the repository public (recommended) so the Pages site is accessible without authentication.
- The workflow uses the built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN` so no extra secrets are required.
- If you rename files, push again — the workflow redeploys on every push to `main`.
